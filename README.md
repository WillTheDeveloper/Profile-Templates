## About these templates:

- They were entirely made by me, myself.
- The content of them are from varying sources (I will credit).
- Placeholder text is lorum ipsum.
- They include pointers and suggestions to what to write in markdown comments.
- *More notes coming soon*

## How to use:

1. Navigate to the directory of templates that suite your style.
2. View the readme which will contain all the examples of what they look like with links.
3. View the link.
4. If you want it, then either copy the contents or fork it.
5. Make sure its kept public on your profile and you will see it appear on the front page.
6. Done!
